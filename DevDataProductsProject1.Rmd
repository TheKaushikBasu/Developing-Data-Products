## Creating Leaflet Map for the Week 2 assignment 
Create a leaflet map object.
```{r cars}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

```

Create a marker with a picture of Victoria Memorial and a link to its homepage.
```{r}
victoriaMemorialIcon <- makeIcon(
   iconUrl = "http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/home/content/en",
   iconWidth = 30*408/255, iconHeight = 30,
   iconAnchorX = 30*408/255/2, iconAnchorY = 30/2
)
```

Add the marker to the map and display the map.
```{r}
victoriaMemorialPopup <- c("<a href= 'http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org' >Victoria Memorial<br><img src='VictoriaMemorial.png' width='210' height='132'  alt='Victoria Memorial' title='Victoria Memorial'></a>")
map %>%
   addTiles() %>%
   addMarkers(lat=22.5448, lng=88.3426, popup = victoriaMemorialPopup)
```
